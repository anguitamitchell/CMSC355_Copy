CMSC 355 - Fundamentals of Software Enginneering

Our project is a medicine adherance system, that allows users to track when they took their medicine. The system will notify the user when they need to take and log their medicine. Doctors can log into the system and receive a report of their patients adherence to their prescribed medicine.
