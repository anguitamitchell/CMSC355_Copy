------------------ Fill in some information about your project under this ------------------

The main goals for this program is to have a streamlined system for adding and discharging patients as well as 
booking E.R., in-patient, and O.R. rooms. The user will also be able to utilize an advanced search for patients 
(both present and past) and provide useful information about them such as a patient’s room number, chart, unique 
identifier number, and schedule. There will also be an easy way for doctors/nurses to book rooms and what times 
they need those rooms as well as a visual interface to show which rooms are available and if not the rooms will 
be color coded to let you know the availability of that room and or any other rooms that may fit your need and 
if they’re available. There will be security and failsafe procedures put into place to make sure the program 
continues to run smoothly without any interruptions.
