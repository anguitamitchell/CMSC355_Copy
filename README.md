This is a project for CMSC 355 - Software Engineering.
We attempted to make a medicine adherence system. It is a full stack program but very rudimentary as there was not much alloted time throughout the semester. The entirety of this project was coded in IntelliJIDE with each of the initial processes divided amongst the group.
