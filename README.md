## Overview

"Admissions due to DRPs have been reported as growing over the past decades. In United States, estimates suggested that Drug-related problems (DRPs) accounted for 17 million emergency department visits and 8.7 million hospital admissions annually." -NIH

Pharmasense AI aims to use AI to detect potential drug interactions, alerting both the patient and healthcare providers about any potential complications with any combination of medications or supplements.

This is for the purpose of reducing risk of adverse drug events, enhancing patient safety, supporting accurate and informed prescribing, improving efficiency in clinical decision-making, and strengthening provider-patient communication.
